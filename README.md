**Instagram 2.0** is my own unique verision of Instagram. A web application that I have built and design independently. Inspired by Pinterest's new productivity feature, I wanted to add a twist to the way users like you and I can organize our photos. Implementing  a re-order feature for each users account will them to have greater control over their content.
